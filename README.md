ticketshare
===========
 In Berlin and other major cities in Germany people with a monthly pass do have a plus one option and hardly ever make use of it. That means that people keep wasting their money on tickets where at the same time others don't make use of their +1-option. My App makes it possible to match ticket seekers with ticket owners, by showing you all individuals with tickets in your surroundings on a map (real time). Works also for long-distance journeys.
